This project is a basic full-stack web application designed to collect, store, and retrieve personal information from users. The frontend is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to provide a simple and interactive interface for data entry and retrieval. The backend handles form submissions, stores user data in a connected database, and enables retrieval of all stored entries upon request.
<br>

Key Features:
	•	User-friendly form to collect personal details such as name, age, email, and other attributes.
	•	Backend functionality to securely handle and store submitted data.
	•	Option to retrieve and display all previously entered records in a readable format.
	•	Clean and intuitive interface for both data input and data review.

 <br>

This project demonstrates the integration of frontend and backend technologies to implement basic CRUD operations in a lightweight and functional web environment.
